    <h1>Note intention study</h1>

    <p>
    In this exercise you're going to be presented with a bunch of random notes and your job
    is to guess <i>why they were taken</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
    For each note, choose a <i>primary category</i> (from the categories below), which
    you think best reflects the purpose the note was taken.  After that, select how
    likely the note is any of the other categories
    </p>

    <p>
    Of course you can't read the mind of the note-taker, so just take you best guesses!
    </p>

    <p>
    If you absolutely haven't a clue what a note means, leave it -no idea-
    </p>

	<dt>journal/activity log
	<dd>something that serves as a record that you did or experienced something, or that something happened

	<dt>posterity
