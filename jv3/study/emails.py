Dear brave List.it alpha tester,

First, THANK YOU for helping us test and find bugs in list.it in its early phases.  Based on your feedback, we've been able to greatly improve list.it's stability and design.   

With list.it finally in good shape, we are launching our note-taking study this Wednesday.

Since we've revised the study considerably signed up for previously, we need you to tell us if you would still like to participate.  If you don't respond, we will assume that you no longer wish to participate.

Here is a summary of the changes:

1. Notetaking exercises:   We're going to send you an e-mail with a link containing some information we want you to capture into a note in list.it, twice a day for ten days starting Wednesday. For example, we might ask you to pretend that you need to remind yourself to pick up groceries for dinner on the way home -- and to write down the thought in list.it. Each exercise should only take a minute or two at most to complete.

2. Monetary rewards:  For each exercise you complete, you get $1.  With twenty exercises delivered over ten days, you can earn $20.  Plus, you could win an additional $50 (1st place) or $25 (two 2nd place prizes) if you use list.it for your own notes, and turn out to be one of the top three note-takers in the study.

If you want to participate in this new study, please click here: %(server_url)s/jv3/reconsent?email=%(email)s

If you wish to withdraw from the study at any time, you can write us at listit@csail.mit.edu. 

And don't forget to please continue using list.it!  List.it is intended for you to capture your thoughts and notes in a convenient way, and at the same time aid PIM research towards helping people build better tools.  Help us help you with your information overload.

Thank you,

the list.it team

Dear %(first_name)s,

Thanks for signing up for the study! This is a quick notice that
we are going to start sending out your daily notes-to-take tomorrow
(thursday US EDT). So, we would like to make everyone is on board.

We need you to do one quick thing as soon as you have a chance.  There
was a teeny problem in our download page that prevented our
\"configure.it\" button from working correctly.  So, we'd like to make
sure you got the correct settings.  Please visit the following link
below (using your list.it Firefox browser):

%(server_url)s/jv3/confirmuser?cookie=%(cookie)s

AND click on \"Configure it\".  When it asks you: \"A script from
listit . nrcc . noklab . com  is requesting enhanced abilities that
are UNSAFE and could be used to compromise your machine or data:
Run or install software on your machine", hit \"Allow\".
Then, it should say:

\"Done. You are all configured for list.it\".

You shouldn\'t need to re-install the client.  Let us know if you have
any problems by replying to this message.

Next, please start using it!  We\'d like you to get comfortable
with it before tomorrow.  

Comments/questions/suggestions? Email us by replying to this message.

Thanks very much!

Yours infoscrappily,

Quick tip: Setting up hotkeys
Did you know that you can open and close list-it from anywhere within 
Firefox using hotkeys?  Here's how:

1. Open the List.it sidebar, click on Options.
3. Click on the text field next to the desired hot key to change.
Open and Close - selects the hot key to pop open and hide the List.it Sidebar
Search - select the hot key to quickly open List.it and focus on search box (coming soon - !)
Input box - select the hot key to open/close the "quick input box"

After you've selected the appropriate text box you want to change, hit your 
desired hot key combination. We recommend
  Ctrl+Shift+L (Windows) or Alt/Meta/Option + Shift + F (Mac/Linux)
If nothing happens, that means that Firefox or some other greedy plugin has 
already claimed that key.  Please try choosing another one.

5. Hit Accept
6. Restart Firefox.  (Firefox 3.0+ internals have an outstanding bug right now that makes restarting required :()

If, upon restart, hotkeys still don't seem to work, please try selecting a different combination. Some people have reported some issues with it, please let us know!

"deadping": ("How are things going?","""

Hi %(first_name)s,

This is a quick note to see how things are going for you with list.it.
We noticed you haven\'t yet set up your synchronization with the
server, so we wanted to explicitly ask you whether everything was going
okay.

1. Were you able to get the client installed okay (and is it working)?
2. Are you receiving note probes (e.g., "write down a reminder..") We sent two today.
3. Do you have any questions/comments?

Please let us know!

Thanks in advance,
Max and Michael (the list.it team)


Ps > If you want to set up synchronization, please do the following :

1. Open your List.it,
2. Click on "Options"
3. Make sure "Enable synchronization" and "Save login information" are enabled.
4. Fill in the following:
   email: (your email address you used for registering with listit)
   password: (your password you used for registering)
   and leave the server as it is.
5. Hit "Accept"

That\'s it! Thanks.
