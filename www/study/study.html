  <h2>What we are studying</h2>

  <p>
    We are conducting an academic research project to gain a
    quantitative understanding of how people create, keep and
    re-access information on a daily basis, in order to figure out how
    to build more effective note-taking and personal information
    management tools for people
    
  <p>In this particular study, we are examining three things:

    <ul>
      <li><i>Why people take notes</i> - 
	The roles served by notes  -- e.g., such as to serve as reminders, to keep track of to-dos, et cetera.
	
      <li><i>How people take notes</i> -
	How quickly notes are taken, how long notes tend to be, what kind of grammar/syntax is used in the notes themselves, et cetera.

      <li><i>When people take and access notes</i> -
	What times people take notes, how often people go back to notes they've already taken, whether people revisit notes while in the same places or looking at the same web pages as when they wrote it down.

    </ul>

    <h2>How you can help</h2>
    
  <p>
    You can help us with our research by giving us permission to
    analyze your notes and note-taking taking practices.  Merely
    giving us permission to do so is very helpful and helps us derive
    important conclusions for our research.

  <p>We may also occasionally send out a survey. Filling out such
    surveys will be of additional great help to us; but you are by no
    means committed to do so.

  <p>Two times each year we raffle off Amazon gift certificates to
    active list-it users who volunteer to let us look at their notes.
    Participation in the study automatically qualifies you to win.
    You will be notified via e-mail if you win.

    <h2>What data we are collecting</h2>

  <p>If you volunteer, you give us permission to look at three  things:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>your notes</li>
    <li>a log keeping track of when you use list-it</li>
    <li>a log keeping <u>limited</u> information about when you revisit the same <i>physical places</i> and <i>web pages</i> (see below)
  </ul>

  <p>
    We NEVER RECORD the identities of the physical locations or the web
    pages you visit.  Instead, your browser picks a random secret
    "nickname" for each place, and sends us that nickname.  It is
    impossible for us to know what those nicknames stand for, but they
    let us know when you are in a place you have visited before.  This
    is important because it helps us test our idea that certain notes
    are always accessed at the same place (or time).
  </p>

  <h2>How your data is protected</h2>

  <p> Your privacy and protection of note contents is our top
    priority.  Participation in the study means that you give
    the researchers listed below access to your note contents
    for statistical analysis.  But, your notes or their contents
    will not be  divulged to anyone outside the researchers
    and will be analyzed for <i>research purposes only</i>.

  <p>
    If the reserachers wish to disclose notes or your data to anyone
    outside the study, they will contact you for explicit permission
    before hand.

    <h2>How can I withdraw from the study?</h2>
    
  <p> Should you choose to withdraw from the study, you can withdraw
    from study participation by going to the Preferences menu and
    clicking "Withdraw from study".  This turns off all Logging for
    Science features in Lisit, and you can continue to use Listit 
    freely to keep your notes. Later, if you decide to
    re-join, you can click on "Join study" again.
  </p>

  <p>
    This does not delete your data from the server, but forbids us
    from looking at it. If you want us to delete your data from the
    server (which will destroy backups of your notes), contact us at
    the below e-mail addresses directly.
  </p>

  <h2> Questions? Comments? </h2>
  
  <p> Please e-mail us any time with any questions, concerns or comments that
    you may have.
