<p> Welcome to the study! We're grateful that you are interested in
helping us with our research efforts.  Here is some information
surrounding the study, what we wish to get out of it, how we will
handle the data we collect and the results.  If you have any
questions, please do not hesitate to contact <a href="#researchers">the researchers</a> via the
contact information below.

<h1>about the study</h1>

<P>This is a study of personal note-taking practice for the purpose
   of achieving a better understanding people's note taking needs.
   Our ultimate is to design better tools for helping people
   keep track of their personal information.
    
<P>This study represents the second phase of our research project,
   in which we wish to see how people use a simple note-taking tool
   that we have developed, called list.it.

<h1>participation and withdrawal</h1>

<P>Your participation in this study is completely voluntary and you
are free to choose whether to be in it or not. If you choose to be in
this study, you may subsequently withdraw from it at any time without
penalty or consequences of any kind.  The investigator may withdraw
you from this research if circumstances arise which warrant doing so.
    
<P>If the investigator determines that you are not fulfilling the
requirements of the study, he/she may decide to terminate the study.

<h1>procedure</h1>

If you volunteer to participate in this study, we would ask you to do the following things:

<h2>preparation</h2>
    
<p>You will be installing a note-taking tool on the one or more
personal computer(s) you use most often. This tool will
require Firefox version 3.0 or above to be installed on each of
these computers, which may be obtained from <a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla.org</a>.

<h2>usage</h2>

<p>You will then be asked to try to make an explicit effort to frequently
use the system over the course of a week to get used to using the
system to help manage your notes.  During this time, we ask you to
keep a diary noting any thoughts that you have regarding the
system.  The researcher(s) will ask for this feedback via periodic
e-mails to you, where you can further elaborate your impressions
from using the system.

<P>After this duration, we ask that you try to use the system as naturally
as you see fit. If you do not feel the need or desire to continue using the
system, you may cease to do so.
    
<P>During the course that you are using the system, your usage of the
system will be logged by the system and periodically automatically
report this to the researchers on their server.  This information is
kept confidential for research purposes only, as described in "Data
Handling" below.

<h1>potential risks</h1>

<p>Risks surrounding this study are minimal.  The software exists as a
standalone firefox plug-in, and all components will be installed in
the user's Firefox profile directory.

<p>As with any computer program, there is a potential risk that the
system may glitch and lose some of the information you have recorded
into it.  While we have installed backup algorithms to make such
possibilities less likely, we cannot guarantee that it will not occur.
As a result, please take precaution to make copies of critical data
that you keep in the system.

<h1>data handling and confidentiality</h1>

<p>The researchers of the study will not share information that he/she
encounters during the interviews, in reviewing the diary, or in
processing the application log data, and all notes surrounding your
data will be coded by participant number rather than name.

<p>Any information that is obtained in connection with this study and
that can be identified with you will remain confidential and will be
disclosed only with your permission or as required by law.  The
software being used may log your usage patterns in order to either
improve its interface, contribute to later research statistics, or
both. This data will be kept on your hard drive and later transferred
to the list.it server (under control of researchers) for analysis â€“ it
will not be shared outside the research group.

<p>During analysis, participants will be given a private numeric
identifier for their records and data. All data will be identified
solely by participant number, so only the head investigator and the
participant will have the ability to link data to names.  The
researcher will retain the number-name correspondences in a secure
location separate from the tapes and data.All retained information
will be only reported in scientific journals in the form of
accumulated statistics and/or the media above.

<p>If other uses of data are contemplated, the researchers will obtain
specific consent at that time by contacting the participant.

<h1>potential benefits</h1>

There will be no direct benefit to the subject for participating in
this research.  It is plausible that the tool we assign you to use may
improve upon your current practices and you may decide to continue its
use.

The benefit to society will focus on improving information management
work for computer users.  If successful, the research will be used
towards designing new tools that make it easier to manage the large
amount of personal information (emails, todos, memories, files) on the
computer.
