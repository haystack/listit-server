<p> Welcome to the study! We're grateful that you are interested in
helping us with our research efforts.  Here is some information
surrounding the study, what we wish to get out of it, how we will
handle the data we collect and the results.  If you have any
questions, please do not hesitate to contact <a href="#researchers">the researchers</a> via the
contact information below. Portions of this legal document that are not relevant
to this particular study will have <span class="strikethrough">strikethrough text</span>.

<h1>about the study &mdash; read this!</h1>

<P>This is a study of personal note-taking practice for the purpose
   of achieving a better understanding people's note taking needs.
   Our ultimate is to design better tools for helping people
   keep track of their personal information.
    
<P>We need you to use list.it like you would otherwise, to capture your thoughts, notes, ideas -- whatever seems appropriate. By signing up for the study, you give us permission to look at your notes and your usage of list.it at the end of the ten days.

<p>Those who sign up for the study will also get e-mails twice a day for ten days containing some information we want you to capture into a note in list.it. For example, we might ask you to pretend that you need to remind yourself to pick up groceries on the way home and to write down the note in list.it.  Each exercise should take about one minute to complete.

<p>And you get paid the big bucks for helping us out. The person who uses list.it the most for his or her own notes gets $50, and the two runners-up get $25 each. Plus, for each of our e-mail exercises you answer, you get $1 -- that's up to $20 over the ten days.

<h1>the legal bits</h1>
   
<p>You are asked to participate in a research study conducted by 
Michael Bernstein (Ph.D Candidate), Vineet Sinha (Ph.D. Candidate), 
and David Karger, Ph.D., from the EECS Department at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.). The results from 
this research will contribute toward continuing Ph.D. thesis work.  
You were selected as a possible participant in this study because you 
work with a variety of personal information and have evolved a 
set of practices surrounding this information. You should read the information below, 
and ask questions about anything you do not understand, before deciding 
whether or not to participate. </p>

<h1>purpose of the study</h1>

<p>This study is designed to evaluate the utility of a novel personal information 
management tool as it is used in everyday practice.  Knowledge gained from 
this study will be used to support or rebuke claims of its abilities.</p> 

<h1>participation and withdrawal</h1>

<P>Your participation in this study is completely voluntary and you
are free to choose whether to be in it or not. If you choose to be in
this study, you may subsequently withdraw from it at any time without
penalty or consequences of any kind.  The investigator may withdraw
you from this research if circumstances arise which warrant doing so.
    
<P>If the investigator determines that you are not fulfilling the
requirements of the study, he/she may decide to terminate the study.

<h1>procedure</h1>

If you volunteer to participate in this study, we would ask you to do the following things:

<h2>preparation</h2>
    
<p>We will be installing a personal information management system on your main computer.  
<span class="strikethrough">The researcher will demonstrate its use and teach you how to use its main features.  
Time: � hour.</span>

<h2>usage</h2>

<p>
You will then be asked to use the system over a determined period of time (multiple days) to manage your personal information.  During that period, you may be asked to keep a diary noting any thoughts that you have regarding the system, and the researcher may schedule periodic interviews with you to further discuss your reactions and opinions.  For example, this may involve taking note of instances where you experience a breakdown in current tools or when you perform a certain action (e.g., send an email to yourself as a reminder).  This procedure may also involve use of automated application logging software written by the researchers to accurately capture use patterns. 

<span class="strikethrough">You may be asked to ensure to use the system at least a specified amount of time per day.  We may be experimentally manipulating the tool we give you and the tasks we ask of you. Your assignment to a particular study condition will be done completely at random.</span>  Time: predefined number of days agreed to by the participant<span class="strikethrough">, with a predefined minimum use time per day</span>.

<div class="strikethrough>
<h2>final interview</h2>

<p>
At the culmination of the period of usage, the researcher will hold 
a final interview with you and distribute a survey to capture final thoughts.  
Time: 1 hour. 

Total length of time: 1.5hrs + required usage over extended period  
</div>

<h1>potential risks</h1>

<p>The researcher will not share any �personal� information that he/she encounters during the interviews, in reviewing the diary, or in processing the application log data, and all notes surrounding your data will be coded by participant number rather than name. 

<p>As with any computer program, there is a potential risk that the system may glitch and lose some of the information you have recorded into it.  This is extremely unlikely to occur. 

<h1>potential benefits</h1>

<p>There will be no direct benefit to the subject for participating in this research<span class="strikethrough"> aside from compensation</span>.  It is plausible that the tool we assign you to use may improve upon your current practices and you may decide to continue its use. 

<p>The research�s benefit to society will focus on improving information management work for computer users.  If successful, the research will make it easier to manage the large amount of personal information (emails, todos, memories, files) on the computer.

<div class="strikethrough">
<h1>payment for participation</h1> 

<p>
The subjects will receive payment in the amount of ___ dollars in the form of a gift certificate upon completion of the study.  If the subject should decide to withdraw or the researcher ends the study early, this amount will be prorated by the percentage of the full investigation period that was completed.
</div>

<h1>confidentiality</h1>
<p>Any information that is obtained in connection with this study 
and that can be identified with you will remain confidential and will be disclosed only 
with your permission or as required by law.  

<p>The software being used may log your usage patterns in order to 
either improve its interface, contribute to later research statistics, or both. 
This data will be kept on your hard drive and later transferred to the researcher�s 
computer for analysis � it will not be shared outside the research group.   

<p class="strikethrough">Portions of this study may be audio- or 
videotaped for later reference by the investigators.  The subject has a right 
to review or edit the tapes.  Only the investigators for 
this research will have access for the tapes, and the tapes will be 
destroyed at the conclusion of the research or upon graduation of the head 
investigator from the Institute (whichever is sooner).  As above, the investigators 
may publish images or clips from the tapes, with express permission.</p>

<p>Participants will be given a private numeric identifier for their records and data. 
All data will be identified solely by participant number, so only the head 
investigator and the participant will have the ability to link data to names.  
The researcher will retain the number-name correspondences in a secure location separate 
from the tapes and data.  Again, the tapes will be destroyed at the conclusion 
of the research or upon graduation of the head investigator from the 
Institute (whichever is sooner).  Data will be similarly stored by participant number.  
All retained information will be only reported in scientific journals in the form 
of accumulated statistics and/or the media above.      

<p>If other uses of data are contemplated, the researchers will obtain specific consent at that time by contacting the participant. 

<h1>emergency care and compensation for injury</h1>
<p>�In the unlikely event of physical injury resulting from participation in this research you may receive medical treatment from the M.I.T. Medical Department, including emergency treatment and follow-up care as needed. Your insurance carrier may be billed for the cost of such treatment. M.I.T. does not provide any other form of compensation for injury.  Moreover, in either providing or making such medical care available it does not imply the injury is the fault of the investigator. Further information may be obtained by calling the MIT Insurance and Legal Affairs Office at 1-617-253 2822.� </p>

<h1>rights of research subjects</h1>
<p>You are not waiving any legal claims, rights or remedies because of your participation in this research study.  If you feel you have been treated unfairly, or you have questions regarding your rights as a research subject, you may contact the Chairman of the Committee on the Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects, M.I.T., Room E25-143B, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, phone 1-617-253 6787.
