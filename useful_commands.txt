useful commands for starting and stopping the jourknow server

python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:12345
  runs the server on all interfaces port 12345

python manage.py syncdb
  creates the database if it doesn't exist, and updates it to reflect the models declared
  in models.py.  You must run this command every time you modify models.py.  If you already
  have stuff in your database, running syncdb may be insufficient.  you may needs to 
  drop the database and re-create it.  if so, you should back up the contents first.

python manage.py dumpdata jv3 > data_backup.json
  dumps an image (backup) of the current database into data_backup.json using json format

python manage.py dumpdata jv3 --format=xml > data_backup.xml
  dumps an image (backup) of the current database into data_backup.xml using xml format

python manage.py loaddata data_backup.json
python manage.py loaddata data_backup.xml
  loads an image into the model 

python manage.py shell 
  enters a python interpreter with all the django stuff declared

So, if you make a major change to your models and want to nuke everything in the db, do it in the
following sequence:

	  python manage.py dumpdata jv3 > data_backup.json
	  rm jv3.db
	  python manage.py syncdb
	  python manage.py loaddata data_backup.json
	  python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:12345

got it, cowboy??
